# ISS Location Notifier ðŸš€

A Python script that notifies you via email when the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead and visible from your location.

## Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Checks ISS location to see if itâ€™s near your coordinates.
- **Nighttime Check**: Confirms itâ€™s dark for better visibility.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends an email notification when conditions are ideal.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (for API calls)

## Configure Script
Replace **MY_LAT, MY_LONG, sender_email, password, and recipient email** in the script with your information.
Use a Gmail app password for enhanced security (recommended).

## Run the Script
python iss_notifier.py

The script will check every minute if the ISS is overhead and visible. If so, it sends an email alert to the specified address.
